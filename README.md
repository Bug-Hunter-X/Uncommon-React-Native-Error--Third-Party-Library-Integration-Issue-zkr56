This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in React Native development: problems integrating third-party libraries.  The `ThirdPartyLibraryBug.js` file showcases a scenario where an incorrect import, improper configuration, or version incompatibility leads to unexpected behavior or crashes. The `ThirdPartyLibraryBugSolution.js` file illustrates the solution, emphasizing correct installation, configuration, and usage of the library. This example uses a hypothetical library for brevity but the principles apply to any third-party package.
