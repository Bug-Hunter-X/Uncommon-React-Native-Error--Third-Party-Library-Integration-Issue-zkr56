To solve this, carefully review the third-party library's documentation for installation and usage instructions.  Ensure the correct version is installed and compatible with your React Native version. Check that you're importing and using the library's APIs correctly. Verify that any necessary native dependencies are properly linked (if applicable). If the problem persists, consider looking for relevant issues in the library's GitHub repository, upgrading React Native and the library to their latest versions, or switching to a different library that provides similar functionality.
